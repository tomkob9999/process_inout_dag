# Process InOut DAG

The tool is to provide solutions to typical problems like below:
- An data element has wrong value.  Where was the cause and where did it go wrong?
- In order to improve the overall performance/throughput, which processes can be parallelized?
- The performance improvements of which process lead to the overall performance improvement most or more?
- Which processes are more critical to the end-to-end completion?


### Input: tab-delimited file containing adjacency matrix (rows=FROM, columns=TO) with headers (adjacency_matrix2.txt as a sample)
### Output: Graph of origin data and offspring data for the specified data element

After processes are created between data fields by genProcesses() command, the graph becomes a bipartite graph and it shows as follows.  Processes can be merged by coupleProcesses() as well.

Well-Alligned Bipartite-DAG Layout

Graphs's are displayed in the well aligned layout.

- It has the following properties.
- The underlying graph data is a DAG
- The underlying graph data is a bipartite graph.
- The chart starts and ends with a data eleent.  They data element and the process should show side by side and each column should only show either of them.

It has two forms: compact and stretched.  Both locate the horizontal positions at the expected completion time.  The compact form uses the assumption that each process takes the same unit duration of 1.  The stretched form uses the weights to represent the horizontal length of edge.  The compact form has better overall visibility and better view of dependencies and parallelism.  The stretched form shows more relistic view of when events start and ends where the vertex indicates the start and the edge arrow indicates the end.

Hilights:

- The graph is kept as a DAG.
- After the processes are added, the graph also becomes a bipartite graph of elements and processes.
- compatible with adjacency matrix and edge list formats.
- The generated flow graphs show as topologically ordered, meaning no edges point backwards.
- any node with the prefix "proc_" is regarded as a process, and everything else is regarded as an element.

Implemented Features
- Edge List file read/write DONE
- generateProcesses  genProcesses() DONE
- DAG check  checkDAG(from, to) DONE
- Process coupling  (process1, process2) DONE
- Link Elements  linkElements(element1, element1) DONE


With edge weights added, this tool can also be used as the schedule planning tool where the inputs and outputs are specified as data elements.  The existing longest path identifies the critical path.

With showWeight option on, the critical path is shown as brown line and the brightness indicates higher the criticality of the process.

Stretched form

The stretch form has a feature of showing edges with wait time in light blue. It shows its wait time in the bracket next to the weight.
For example, in the diagram below, proc_COL88 flows into proc_COL90 and the wedge shows 2 (& 2).  proc_COL90 starts 2 clocks, or steps, after proc_COL88 arrives because it also has proc_COL86 as the pre-condition and it needs to wait for its arrival.
